                            I have a premier practice in government contract litigation, investigations, and protests, offering significant depth and experience to government contractors and others doing business with the Federal government. My team draws from the skills and experience of one of the most prominent regulatory practices in the country. I am admired and well-known for my expertise in effectively and efficiently handling a variety of government contracts litigation.
                        </p>

                        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed xl:font-rlight font-rregular xl:text-[15px] lg:text-[12px] md:text-sm sm:text-[12px] xs:text-[11px] text-[10px]">
                            My representations of government contractors have involved virtually all the substantive issues arising from doing business with the government. These issues come into play both in lawsuits involving government agencies directly and in disputes between commercial parties, such as subcontractors and prime contractors, in which the relationship derives from a government contract and its use of “flow-down” provisions.
                        </p>

                            A significant portion of my work in this area relates to matters alleging criminal or civil fraud. These typically involve complex accounting issues stemming from the regulatory overlay specific to government contracting. Additionally, I have been involved significantly in international procurement disputes, appearing before the International Chamber of Commerce and in International Arbitration.
                        </p>

                            I blend the capabilities of subject matter experts with a team of litigation and investigation lawyers who have handled some of the most complex and notable government contract-related investigations in recent years.
