                            The intention of administrative law is to provide a legal framework for regulating the powers, 
                            procedures, and acts of public administration. All matters in this relation are referred to an 
                            administrative tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction to determine applications made by persons in 
                            the service of the republic regarding their terms and conditions of service.

                            Rule of law eschews arbitrariness or decisions based on whim, promoting fairness and equality

                            just, and fair, avoiding arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive practices.
