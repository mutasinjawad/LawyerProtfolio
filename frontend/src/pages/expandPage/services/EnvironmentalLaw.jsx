                            Global warming, also known as climate change, refers to the observed century-scale rise in the Earthâ€™s average temperature and its related impacts. As the need to protect the environment becomes increasingly urgent, the range of environmental law issues facing companies has expanded. These issues now encompass not only land development, waste management, and permitting, but also concerns like climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon footprints.
