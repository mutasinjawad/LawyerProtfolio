                            I provide expert advisory, drafting, and advocacy services in both domestic and international arbitration. Arbitration is distinct from litigation, with its own specialized body of rules and procedures. Successful arbitration requires an in-depth understanding of these rules and the process, from the initial filing to the final award. My extensive experience in arbitration, with a track record of over 90% success, allows me to creatively present the strongest case for my clients.

                            Unlike litigation, arbitration procedures are flexible and are customized to fit the unique needs of each case. The process is informal, with an emphasis on professional, less adversarial presentations. Arbitration hearings are adjudicated by arbitrators who are often experts in both the process and the subject matter of the dispute. This gives parties a unique advantage, as arbitrators’ decisions are not bound by legal precedents.
                        </p>

                            With over 25 years of experience handling complex international and domestic arbitration cases, I regularly serve as an arbitrator in significant proceedings. My practice spans a wide range of industries, and I also specialize in drafting tailored arbitration clauses to maximize my clients’ positions in arbitration. I analyze factors such as rules, venue, arbitrator selection, and discovery procedures to craft clauses that best serve my clients.
                        </p>

                            In every arbitration, I focus on selecting the appropriate arbitrator, understanding their potential approach, and proposing customized procedures to enhance the arbitration process. I also conduct pre-arbitration assessments and mock arbitration sessions to identify case strengths and weaknesses, ensuring optimal preparation for hearings.
