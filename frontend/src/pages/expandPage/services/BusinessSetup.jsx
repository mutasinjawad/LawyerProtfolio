                            Bangladesh presents promising opportunities for both local and foreign investors—particularly in the energy, pharmaceutical, information technology, and labor-intensive sectors. The government encourages foreign investment, especially in infrastructure and energy projects, and offers a range of incentives under its industrial policy and export-oriented growth strategy. There are minimal formal distinctions between foreign and domestic private investors, making the country an attractive destination for business expansion.
